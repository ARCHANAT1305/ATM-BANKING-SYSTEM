# EXP-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM
## AIM:
To draw a UML diagram for ATM and BANKING SYSTEM.
## SRS (PROCEDURE):
step 1: Gather information about the system, its components, and user interactions.   
step 2:  List the key entities, classes, objects, and relationships that need to be represented.   
Step 3: Identify how the elements interact (e.g., associations, dependencies, inheritance).   
Step 4: Select a UML diagramming tool and start drawing the diagram.   
Step 5:Position elements (classes, actors, etc.) on the diagram and draw relationships between them.
